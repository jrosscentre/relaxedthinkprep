<h1> A Relaxed Approach to Academics Promotes a Growth Mindset</h1>

<h2> Hyper Focus on Grades </h2>
<p>
In today's society, everyone is expected to go to college if they have relatively any money. This has caused an influx in the importance parents put on the grades their kids come home with. Schools have raised standards due to the increase in school attendence of the overall population for so many years now. Parents have therefore put more pressure on their kids to succeed in school. A college education has become expensive, making it more important, to the parents paying for that education, for their kids to do well. A parent will naturally expect something to come from their children with such an investment in their preparation for the adult world. A student, depending on the climate of a household, will feel more or less, but to some degree for certain. Becuae of the efficentcy the mass populations attending colleges required for a school to operate, grades have become the way by which we are compared and catagorized in the academic world. This stress compiled with the pressure of parents causes a stressful environment to study in. Haviing to devote brian capacity to worrying about grades takes away from the overall learning experience that should be participated in. This is why the learner should never be concerned with how their grade will be while in the process of styding and taking a test. Thinking in this way only takes energy and brain capacity away from the problem at hand. It is expected that the grade at the end will ultimately work hard on the exam and preparation, but If a course interests you and you really would like to focus you studies there, dont worry about a grade, but worry about how you are doing in the class, how are you understanding the concepts, honestley. To take a systematic approach to thinking about your studies will help take the focus off of the actuall grade and do more self reflection. Being in tune with how your brain is going to retain and what methods are you goin to have to utilize in order to retain that information. focusing on these things help you actually learn the material rather than how to succeed on the test.

<p> this may or may not be a conception, but it is a tendency of the overall population that should be challenged</p>
<h2>Argument analysis</h2>
<p>
I began my argument with many common facts that every preson relates to becuase I refferenced money. I explained the whys of the common knowledge that people may or may not have thought of, which entices the audience. SO far I have not mentioned anything that would cause a backfire and reveal my cause to make the audience make associations and be turned away. I continue to relate the money aspect to the parents expectations, which every student feels this to some degree. i mention that is is just the nature of it which stabelized the argument. As I build to the turning point of the argument, I mention the overall mental capacity school requires in today's system to connect the audience back to a common ground before landing on the essential argument. this manipulation of the audience is what was explained in the reading (and watching) as a way to avoid promoting associations with precomceptions that will turn the audience off to what you have to say because it goes against their previous knowledge. By beginning on a common ground with the audience, It distracts the audience from the beliefs one is trying to promote. Slowely, and simply building to the essential question and ending with something reader can take away
